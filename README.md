# usurp - Utterly Stupid Unprotected Reversed Proxy

I needed a ultra-lightweight reverse proxy for dumping some HTTP traffic. Putting it into a Git repo so I can keep track of it, 
but also so others can borrow ideas from it. It only does HTTP (not HTTPS) and it can only dump everything on a specified
port to a file. If that's all you need, this may be for you!
